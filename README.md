## Task

Your task is to write a scrum (or kanban) board, with possibility to dynamically add
columns. That means, that on the first opening there should be no columns at all, and
those has to be added manually. Column has to have a title.

Column can be renamed or deleted. Columns can contain tasks.

Task can be added into any of the columns. Task itself has a title, which is displayed
in the board. Title can be changed by opening task in a modal. Also, by opening task
in modal, there will be possibility to add a description of a task.

Task can be dragged into different columns via drag'n'drop.

Task can be deleted.

Task can be accessed via tasks url, where information is displayed: title, description,
column title in which task is now, time when task was created and when it was edited.
Also task can be deleted in this page.

### Requirements

Use react and redux.

Store all columns and tasks into localstorage.

### Advanced

Possibility to add different scrum (or kanban) boards, with possibility to assign alises
to them, by which board can be opened.

### Example

Example boards can be found on any managed board solutions, for example
asana.com


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
